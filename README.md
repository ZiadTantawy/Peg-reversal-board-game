# Peg Reversal Board Game
Peg Reversal is a single-player board game implemented in Haskell, where the goal is to flip all pegs from black to white. The game is played on a '+' shaped board, and the player starts with one white peg among black pegs. Players flip black pegs to white through valid moves, where a peg can only be flipped if it is adjacent to an existing white peg. The objective is to flip all pegs on the board to white in order to win. This project demonstrates functional programming concepts, including recursion, data structures, and state management in Haskell.
